# Local Context Injection System

Trellis context injection aims to make AI read the right files at the right time instead of relying on model memory. In a user project, injection is implemented by `.trellis/` scripts together with platform hooks, agents, and skills.

## Injected Context Types

| Type | Source | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| session context | `.trellis/scripts/get_context.py` | Current developer, git status, active task, active tasks, journal, packages. |
| workflow context | `.trellis/workflow.md` | Current Trellis flow and next action. |
| work context | `get_context.py --mode work` | Explicit work types, selected package rules and current research state. |
| extra spec context | Optional task JSONL | Additional curated references for a worker. |
| task context | `.trellis/tasks/<task>/prd.md` plus optional notes | Delivery scope and status; links to scientific evidence. |
| platform context | Platform hooks/settings/agents | Lets different AI tools read the files above through their own mechanisms. |

## session-start

Platforms with session-start support inject a Trellis overview when a session starts, clears, compacts, or receives a similar event. Injected content usually includes:

- workflow summary.
- current task status.
- active tasks.
- spec index paths.
- selected work scope and a linked research record's current state, not its history.
- developer identity and git status.

If the user feels the AI does not know the current task in a new session, first check whether the platform's session-start hook or equivalent mechanism is installed and running.

## workflow-state

workflow-state is a lightweight hint injected around each user turn. Based on current task status, it selects a block from `.trellis/workflow.md`, such as `no_task`, `planning`, `in_progress`, or `completed`.

If the user wants to change "what the AI should do next in a given state," edit the corresponding state block in `.trellis/workflow.md` first.

## sub-agent context

Agents need the context for their assignment, not necessarily a task. Two modes:

1. **hook push**: scoped rule bodies/current research state, optional JSONL and task artifacts share one configured budget.
2. **agent pull**: an agent reads selected work context and relevant bodies directly, adding supplied task context when present.

Scope comes from explicit arguments or task metadata (`work_types`,
`package_path`, `research_record`). Hooks do not infer it from keywords.
Missing optional manifests do not block work. Current-state excerpts must not
be replaced with the full record by duplicate manifest reads. Summaries and
indexes are navigation: read omitted bodies/history when the assignment needs them.

## JSONL Reading Rules

`implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` contain one JSON object per line:

```jsonl
{"file": ".trellis/spec/backend/index.md", "reason": "Backend rules"}
```

Readers should skip rows without a `file` field (e.g. legacy `_example` placeholders). When configuring JSONL, the AI should include only spec/research files, not pre-register code files that will be modified.

## Active Task And Context Key

Active task state lives in `.trellis/.runtime/sessions/` and is isolated per session. Hooks try to resolve the context key from platform events, environment variables, transcript paths, or `TRELLIS_CONTEXT_ID`.

If shell commands cannot see the same context key, `task.py current --source` may report no active task. In that case, check whether the platform passes session identity into the shell instead of hand-writing a global current-task file.

## Local Customization Points

| Need | Edit location |
| --- | --- |
| Change session-start injected content | The platform's `session-start` hook or plugin file. |
| Change per-turn workflow-state rules | `[workflow-state:STATUS]` block in `.trellis/workflow.md`. The platform workflow-state hook parses these blocks verbatim and embeds no fallback text. |
| Change how sub-agents read context | Platform agent definitions, the `inject-subagent-context` hook, or agent preludes. |
| Change JSONL validation/display | `.trellis/scripts/common/task_context.py`. |
| Change active task resolution | `.trellis/scripts/common/active_task.py`. |

When modifying context injection, verify two things: new sessions can see the correct task, and sub-agents can see the correct task artifacts/spec/research.
